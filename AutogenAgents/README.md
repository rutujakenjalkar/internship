# 🤖 AG2 (AutoGen Framework) - AI Agents Suite

**AG2** is an open-source programming framework for building AI agents and facilitating their cooperation to solve tasks efficiently and intelligently.

This directory contains multiple autonomous agents developed using the [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) framework as part of my internship project. Each agent is designed for a specific task and demonstrates capabilities such as multi-agent communication, workflow automation, and AI coordination.
